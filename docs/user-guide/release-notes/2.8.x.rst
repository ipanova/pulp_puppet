Pulp Puppet 2.8.0
=================

New Features
------------

- This release drops the following three indexes using a database migration which runs as part of
  the `pulp-manage-db` command:
   - `tag_list`
   - `name_1_version_1_author_1`
   - `author`
- This release also adds an index for `author_1_name_1_version_1`
- The install distributor normalizes uid, gid, and filesystem permissions.
   - Extracted files and directories will inherit the uid and gid of the pulp process that extracts
     them.
   - Because some puppet modules contain files with problematic filesystem permissions, pulp ensures
     minimum permissions of 0644 for regular files and 0755 for directories.
- This release adds support for the /releases/{user}-{module}-{version} endpoint of the Puppet Forge v3 API
